To encode the string for this problem, we loop through each element we're given and 'count' the number of times we
see any given character, and store these in a dictionary. We can use a heap to store the occurrences
of an element in the string.
Once we've gone through everything, we compress it.
To decode, we expand on those values we've stored in the same way.
The runtime complexity for both encoding and decding the data is O(n^2), where n is the number
of characters, where we loop through twice to first count and then store the occurrences.
