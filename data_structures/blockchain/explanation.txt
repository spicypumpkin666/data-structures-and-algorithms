Each block contains data, a timestamp, the previous block's hash, and then it's own hash that is calculated using hashlib
library's sha256() function.
Each block is then connected to a node, and each node points, again, to the previous node (rather than, as with a traditional
linked list, to the next node). Each of these nodes are linked together using the Blockchain class.

The runtime of the creation of this chain is O(n) where n is the number of blocks.
