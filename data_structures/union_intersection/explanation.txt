To create the union, we walk through both linked lists completely and add every value to an
array to store. Then we sort that array and call set() which ensures each value appears only once,
and then, for each value in that updated set, we create a new linked list and return that.
The runtime complexity is O(3n log(n))

To create the intersection, we again run through each linked list but this time append their values
to two separate arrays. Then we create a third array that is only the values that appear in both the
first and second arrays. We perform the same actions on that final array- set and sort- and then
create and return a final linked list of those values only.
The runtime complexity is O(3n log(n))
