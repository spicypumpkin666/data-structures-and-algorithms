The active directory problem is another tree problem. I used depth first search again. The method is to first search through
the users in the first group, and if the user is not there, to search through users in the next level of groups, until
you find the user, using recursion.

The runtime is O(n * number of groups).
The space complexity is O(b*m) where m is the longest path, and b is the number of sibling nodes along the path.
