The file structure is basically a tree. I used depth first search to traverse the tree.
Using os, we check which items in the current dir are files. We add those to the list of files
we're returning, and then recursively walk through the sub directories within the current dir
to find more files.
The run time is O(n*number_of_paths) where n is the total number of files / dirs in the path,
times the number of paths I need to traverse.
